The other day, I was discussing loneliness with my friend, and then randomly, when I was scrolling through Instagram, I got an ad for ‘A hugging pillow.’ It seemed interesting; I googled more about it. One thing led to another, and it somehow landed in my Amazon shopping cart. So, it doesn't matter what the platform is, be it Instagram, Amazon, or Google; everybody is listening to us, and we are doomed. 

Speaking about platforms, today, I'll be switching my platform from AWS to GCP. I'll be starting another end-to-end Uber Data analytics project. 

1) The data will be stored on Google Cloud Storage - object storage

2) We will write transformation logic in Python, and deploy this code onto an open-source data pipelines tool called MAGE, running on Compute Engine.

3) Post that the data will be loaded onto the BigQuery, which is a data warehouse available on GCP, this is where we will write SQL queries and analyze our data.

4) We will build our final dashboard on Looker Studio, a web-based data visualization and reporting tool. 

There's a lot to learn from this project; we will write transformation logic, build the data model, understand the basics of GCP services and how to connect them together, and build our final dashboard.

Do buy the pillow and thank me later.
